Manage multiple environments in one place.

# Why use virtualenvwrapper?     
Easy organization of multiple virtual environments and simple streamlined commands. 

### Key Features     
* Places all of your virtual environments in a single directory.
* Wrappers for creating/copying/removing environments.
* Single command to switch between environments.
* Tab completion. 
* User-defined operation hooks.
* Plugin system for generating extensions.

## Installation Process    
### Basic virtualenv    
Installing the base virtual env is outlined below.    
```python3
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv ENV
$ source bin/activate
```
## Virtualenvwrapper
To install `virtualenvwrapper`, we follow a similar pattern.    
### Install the package
Use pip to install the package.
```python3
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper
```
### Create a home directory for all your virtual environments.
Now that we've installed `virtualenvwrapper`, let's start using it. We'll first set an environmental variable `WORKON_HOME`, and point it to our target folder `/Envs` rather than the default `~/.virtualenvs` location.

We will do the same for projects with `PROJECT_HOME`.

**Add the following to your Shell start up file.**
```python3
$ export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
$ export PROJECT_HOME=$WORKON_HOME/Projects
$ mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
$ source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

**NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS:**    
Use the following to add the lines to the bashrc file, you shouldn't edit it with any windows apps, it can cause issues and result in a necessary re-installation of Ubuntu.     
``` echo 'export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs'>> ~/.bashrc ```    
``` echo 'export PROJECT_HOME=$WORKON_HOME/Projects' >> ~/.bashrc```    
``` echo 'mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME' >> ~/.bashrc```  
``` echo 'source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh' >> ~/.bashrc```    

**Additionally** you may need to use the following command as well if you're using Python3:    
``` echo 'export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3' >> ~/virtualenvwrapper.sh```

### Create new environments/projects   
We can make a new environment by using `mkvirtualenv` followed by your desired environment name. 
```python3
$ mkvirtualenv env_1
$ mkvirtualenv env_2
$ mkvirtualenv env_3
```
**Useful Option:**     
Use `-r` to specify a file containing a list of packages you'd like installed upon construction of the environment.    
*Example*: `$ mkvirtualenv env_4 -r file_with_listed_packages.txt`

### View Available Environments    
We can view environments using `ls` with our environmental variable, or `lsvirtualenv`. 
```python3
$ ls $WORKON_HOME

# Or simply
lsvirtualenv
```

### Swap projects/environments    
Moving between environments is pleasantly simple, we can call `workon` with a desired environment name.
```python3
(env_1)$ workon env_2
```

### Remove an environment
We can remove environments with `rmvirtualenv` with the target name, but if it's an active directory we have to deactivate our instance first, which we'll do next. 
```python3
rmvirtualenv env_1
```

### Deactivate    
When you're finished working in an active virtual environment, you can end the session with `deactivate`, reflected by the removal of the parenthesized (env_1) affixed to the left of the money symbol.

If you wanted to remove `env_1` while you're already engaged with it, you'd first deactivate with `deactivate`.     
```python3
(env_1)$ deactivate
```

### Virtualenv Directory Shortcut
To quickly hop to your virtual environment home directory, you can call `cdvirtualenv`.
```python3
(env_1)$ cdvirtualenv
```
