title: "Fun with Data Scraping"
---

So, let's say you want to grab data from a website, but there's no API to connect to?

What do you do?

One solution is to utilize a scripting language to engage in data scraping.

In this case, we're going to probe the US Census website, and grab all the data we can.

Additionally, we want to make that data accessible as quickly as possible, so we're also going
to use the Pandas package to quickly transform the data into a dataframe, which will allow us to 
analyze the data immediately with Pandas, Numpy, or R.
