Bitcoin: A Digital Goldrush?

Market capitalization is realized through a simple formula:
## Market Price of a Single Share X Number of Shares Outstanding

Digital currencies are all the rage, and may currently be imploding. We'll have to wait and find out what happens in due time.

While we wait, we can at least gawk at the obscene amount of value they have generated in their infancy. 

We're going to survey the field of cryptocurrencies currently on market, and calculate the wealth contained within via a market capitalization analysis. To accomplish this, we're going to utilize Python and Pandas to generate our data, and visualize it with MatPlotLib using a Jupyter Notebook. 

# Getting Started - Loading Data

So, let's grab some data from the available API and see what we have. 
First, notice we've imported Pandas as pd, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, and set our style to fivethirtyeight, I'd also suggest setting it to ggplot for another snazzy(and professional) theme. 

```Python

# Importing pandas
import pandas as pd

# Importing matplotlib and setting aesthetics for plotting later.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg' 
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# Reading in current data from coinmarketcap.com
current = pd.read_json("https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/")

```
# Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA

As always, let's start by taking a peek at what we have.

```Python

# Print Column Names
print(current.columns)

# Check Head
print(current.head())

# Check Tail
print(current.tail())

```

Our output looks like this...

```Python

       'market_cap_usd', 'max_supply', 'name', 'percent_change_1h',

Let's make note of our columns, immediately we should realize we don't even need our simple market capitalization formula, as it's already been calculated for us as 'market_cap_usd'.

Let's make a quick list of useful columns:

- id
- market_cap_usd
- percent_change_24h  
- percent_change_7d

Now, we've only peeked at a limited set of the JSON data, so let's look at a more comprehensive list from a stored csv that's been translated from the JSON source.

```Python

# Read the CSV
csv_data = pd.read_csv('datasets/coinsJan2018.csv')
raw_df = pd.DataFrame(csv_data)

# Extract 'id' and 'market_cap_usd' 
market_cap_raw = raw_df[['id','market_cap_usd']]

# Using .info()
print(market_cap_raw.info())

# Summary Statistics
print(market_cap_raw.describe())

# Counting the number of values
market_cap_raw.count()

```

```Python

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

RangeIndex: 1474 entries, 0 to 1473
Data columns (total 2 columns):
id                1474 non-null object
market_cap_usd    1123 non-null float64
dtypes: float64(1), object(1)

       market_cap_usd
count    1.123000e+03
mean     4.737687e+08
std      6.510767e+09
min      1.200000e+01

id                1474
market_cap_usd    1123
dtype: int64

```

Notice that the id and market_cap_usd values are different? We have missing data. We need to handle that.

There are multiple ways to handle the missing data, often we will choose to simply utilize `.dropna()`, but in this case let's use `.query()`.

```Python

# Filtering out rows without a market capitalization
market_cap_filtered = market_cap_raw.query('market_cap_usd > 0')

# Counting the number of values again
print(market_cap_filtered.info())
print(market_cap_filtered.count())

```

```Python

<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Int64Index: 1123 entries, 0 to 1122
Data columns (total 2 columns):
id                1123 non-null object
market_cap_usd    1123 non-null float64
dtypes: float64(1), object(1)
memory usage: 21.9+ KB
None


id                1123
market_cap_usd    1123
dtype: int64

```

Great! We've removed the missing/non-capitalized coins from our dataset. 

Now we can proceed.

Let's get a sense of the distributions of value within the crypto field. We're going to plot the top 10 currencies ranked by
market capitalization and displayed as a bar plot. Bar plots are great in this situation because they communicate a density of information with easy audience intuition, and fit our situation as we are binning categorical data by 'id'.

First, let's make some decisions about what we're doing to help frame our process. Let's set our title, and the y-axis labels
as 'Top 10 Currencies by Market Cap', and 'Percent Total (%)'
`TOP_TEN_TITLE = ''Top 10 Currencies by Market Cap''`
`TOP_TEN_YLABEL = 'Percent Total (%)'`

We can neglect naming the X-axis because we're going to be displaying the names of each coin, so we don't need to communicate this label to our audience for them to understand the plot and properly interpret the data, otherwise you should really give more consideration about your axes designations. Your goal is not only to communicate data, but also give your audience the variables they need to understand what they're looking at, to craft their own analysis, and ask intelligent questions.   

Let's use slicing to return the top ten results already sorted for us, so we don't need to utilize a sorting method now (spoiler: We will later) to yield our list.

So, we will slice indices `[0:10]` from our filtered list and set our index to `id`

`top_10 = pd.DataFrame(market_cap_filtered[0:10]).set_index('id')`

Now let's do some math with our dataframe, and create a new column using `.assign` and named `market_cap_percent`, with index values representing the percentage of each coin's market cap. The math is simply each coin's value divided by the total market's multiplied by 100, which we will model as:

`# market_cap_perc`
`top_10 = top_10.assign(market_cap_perc=(top_10.market_cap_usd / market_cap_filtered.market_cap_usd.sum()) * 100)`

# Plotting the barplot with the title defined above
ax = top_10.plot.bar(title=TOP_CAP_TITLE)
# Annotating the y axis with the label defined above
ax.set_ylabel(TOP_CAP_YLABEL)
#plt.show()

<INSERT IMAGE>
       
Ok, it works, but it's not pretty.

Let's throw in some new color, and set our y-axis to a log scale to deal with the large numbers(180 billion in BitCoin's case).

```Python

# Colors for the bar plot
COLORS = ['orange', 'green']

# Plotting market_cap_usd as before but adding the colors and scaling the y-axis
ax = top_10.plot.bar(title = TOP_CAP_TITLE, color = COLORS)
ax.set_yscale('log')

# Annotating the y axis with 'USD'
ax.set_ylabel('USD')

# Final touch! Removing the xlabel as it is not very informative
ax.set_xlabel('')
plt.show()

```


Part II: Measuring volatility

```Python

# Selecting the id, percent_change_24h and percent_change_7d columns
volatility = raw_df[['id', 'percent_change_24h', 'percent_change_7d']]
# Setting the index to 'id' and dropping all NaN rows
volatility = volatility.dropna().set_index('id')
# Sorting the DataFrame by percentage_change_24h in ascending order
volatility = volatility.sort(columns = 'percent_change_24h', ascending = True)
# Checking the first few rows
volatility.head()

```
