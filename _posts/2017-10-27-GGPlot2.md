title: ggplot() Manipulation + Python/Pandas - Part 2
---

<img src="/Images/GGPlotTitle.jpg" class="inline"/><br>
In part two of this introduction to ggplot(), we're going to use Python and Pandas to generate 
a dataframe, create a .csv file from that dataframe, and then visualize the data with R. 


I wrote this small program to model this situation, hosted on GitHub at:
[Pandas_Flexible_Matrix](https://github.com/ajh1143/Pandas_Flexible_Matrix "Visit"), which we'll be using for the turorial.

We'll also be using Trinket to display the code and allow user interaction within your browser!
