title: The Infamous p-Value!
---
Students and professionals everywhere recite the p-value in terms of their data sets, with varying accuracy.

What is it, and what is it not? 

First things first, it IS arbitrary, but it IS useful. It's most useful in the hands of a capable scientist, who can put it
in context of their data, and the overall picture. It can be used and abused, but it can also be helpful in following
a line of evidence, or an experimental thread. 

Most importantly, YOU should understand it, so YOU can make an informed decision as to whether you're being sold false goods,
cherry picked results, or "meh" information.
