title: Linear Regression Analysis - Part 2

Now that you understand the Pearson test, let's start working towards a real world example. But first...

You're likely going to be pulling your variables from a structured database, so, what would this look like?

Table - ProductInformation

| Brand | Price | Rating | SalesTerritory | Sales |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|
|Brand A| 50.00 | 2.5 | Territory A| 323|
|Brand A| 50.00 | 5.0 | Territory B| 891|
|Brand A| 50.00 | 1.0 | Territory C| 104|
|Brand B| 45.00 | 5.0 | Territory A| 1240|
|Brand B| 45.00 | 4.0 | Territory B| 843|
|Brand B| 45.00 | 4.0 | Territory C| 923|
|Brand C| 55.00 | 3.5 | Territory A| 409 |
|Brand C| 55.00 | 5.0 | Territory B| 822| 
|Brand C| 55.00 | 4.5 | Territory C| 659 |

SQL is fun, and easy to learn! It's worth your time to get a handle of the basic syntax, which is highly transferable between
flavors; SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc all share largely the same fundamental querying verbage. I'll give you a few simple functional
examples.

Let's say you are only interested in Brand A, you could extract it's information with the following query:

>SELECT * FROM ProductInformation WHERE Brand = 'Brand A'

Your output would be:

| Brand | Price | Rating | SalesTerritory | Sales |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----:|
|Brand A| 50.00 | 2.5 | Territory A| 323|
|Brand A| 50.00 | 5.0 | Territory B| 891|
|Brand A| 50.00 | 1.0 | Territory C| 104|

Now, let's say you wanted to find the poorest performing region for Brand A, and return a list ranked by lowest sales.

You would query:

>SELECT SalesTerritory, Rating, Sales FROM ProductInformation ORDER BY TotalSales ASC

Your output would be:

|SalesTerritory | Rating | Sales |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Territory C|  1.0 | 104|
|Territory A|  2.5 | 323|
|Territory B|  5.0 | 891|

You can even engage in data analysis and manipulation using SQL. Reusing the above example, we will generate a report with
a column called "TotalSales" that sums up the sales throughout each division:

>SELECT SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales FROM ProductInformation

|TotalSales|
|:-:|
|6214|
