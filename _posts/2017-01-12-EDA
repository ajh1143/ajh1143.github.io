DO YOUR HOMEWORK!

As a data scientist, you should approach your discipline with a strong basis rooted in hard science. One of 
your primary goals, is to keep an open mind. Follow the data even if it doesn't match your 
intuition. Sometimes your intuition is a great asset! But, odds are, there are patterns and 
relationships in the data you're not going to divine by intuition alone. You'll need some help.

One way to do this is to engage in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA allows us to do exactly as I stated prior, peek into the layers of information and find 
relationships, regardless of your intuition or knowledge. Best of all, you can do this 
visually with relative ease. In a previous post 'Machine learning 101' we utilized the 
scatter_matrix(). This will be a frequently used tool in your career to spot relationships 
between independent and dependant variables. But there are other options as well, and 
you'll want to pick one that fits your dataset.

EDA isn't just useful for predictive opportunities, it's also a fundamental step in understanding your data.
We've already utilized the approach, for example, when parsing our data to look for missing or null values, 
view total entries, assay data types. You use EDA to understand your data.

The primary groups of EDA include: Univariate, multivariate, non-graphical, and graphical.

You'll also want to consider whether your data/question include qualitative, 
quantitative, categorical, and continuous features when developing your analytical approach. 

For example, let's say you were working exclusively with categorical data, which 
results in a binary set of choices. Yes/no, with/without, higher/lower etc. Here, you'd 
want to utilize something like countplot() from the Seaborn package to follow your EDA 
investigative thread rather than the scatter_matrix() approach.

Other times, you'll be working with continuous data, and you may just want to look for outliers or compare means, plot histograms, 
probabilities, box plots, and standard deviations.

For the most part, EDA is a simple procedure that yields tremendous value in both information, and in time efficiency.

So, again, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
