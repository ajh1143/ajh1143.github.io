# HexBinGenerator
Today, we're going to develop a small program to generate a handy HexBin plot that will allow us to simply define the source file, our desired x and y attributes, gridsize, and extents.

# What is a Hex Bin?
A `Hex Bin` is a plot formed by hexagonal tessellation of bivariate data points. For example, we could be looking at a dataset containing observations of drug treatment dosages, and enzymatic rates, both recorded as continuous data. Perhaps we could hope to identify the ideal dose by comparing our suspected effect on a target enzyme. 

## What Does It Do?
Unlike a simple scatter plot, which plots each observation as a single point, we are instead plotting the **density** of observations 
within a bin.

## Why Is That Helpful?
Many reasons! Like everything in statistics, there are many rules where it might be useful, and where it might not be useful. One such case of the approach being advantageous, is when there are many overlapping datapoints. A swarmplot could be used to seperate the points, but we'll talk about that another time. In the case of the Hexbin, we get a clear picture of density, distributions, and relative ranges, similar to a heat map. However, unlike a heat map, the shape of the hexagon allows us to limit the effects of edge biases found in square bins, while retaining the ability to form a continuous grid. 

# Getting Started 

## Documentation

In order to build a plot, we'll first peek at the documentation, we find the simplest case: `matplotlib.pyplot.hexbin(x, y)`
where x and y are bivariate datasets.

We will build on this for our program adding in the following parameters:

`gridsize` - Set the number of hexagons in the x-direction, or x and y direction. The default is 100.

`extents` - Set X & Y bin sizes.

`cmap` - Set a unique color map.

Another useful parameters we aren't using:

`edgecolor`- Allows us to set the color around each bin, useful for clearly separating each bin via 'white'. 


## Imports

```Python3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Build DataFrame: Chunk, Iterate, Concatenate For Big Files!

```Python3
def get_data(file):
    """
    :param file: file location/name
    :return df: dataframe of file
    """
    df = pd.read_csv(file, iterator=True, chunksize=100)
    df1 = pd.concat(df, ignore_index=True)
    return df1
```

## Build HexBin Plot, Customize As Needed!

```Python3
def hexBinning(df, x, y, ext):
    """
    :param df: dataframe with target data
    :param x: name of x feature
    :param y: name of y feature
    :param ext: [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] from a list for hexbinning, similar to setting axes
    :return: generates a plot
    """
    #Build Hexbin
    plt.hexbin(df[x], df[y], gridsize=(15, 15))
    # Title, Axes
    plt.title('Hex Plot')
    plt.xlabel(x)
    plt.ylabel(y)
    # Add color bar
    plt.colorbar()
    # Display
    plt.show()
```

## Example Output

## Run It

```Python3
if __name__ == '__main__':
    #pass file location/name
    file1 = input("File")
    df = get_data((file1))
    x_col = input("X Column Name") 
    y_col = input("Y Column Name")
    x_min = input("X Min")
    x_max = input("X Max")
    y_min = input("Y Min")
    y_max = input("X Max")
    axes = [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max]
    hexBinning(df,x_col, y_col, axes)
```
