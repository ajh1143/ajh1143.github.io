title: Homoscedasticity and You
---

Before you do a t-test, there are factors you need to test. Homogeneity of the variance is one of them.

We should talk about the concept of homoscedasticity before we get too far. 

Homo = Same

Scedasticity = Scatter

We want out data points to be scaterred around a regression line with homoegeous variance and homoscedacity if we wish 
to use the t-test. The simplest explanation I've been taught is to just think of, variance within variance. You want as little 
variance in your variance as possible to continue with a t-test. 

Here are some images to help frame heterscedastic patterns vs homoscedastic patterns in your data
