Almost anything you need for aggressive data-fu, is ready to go in R. 

The T-test is one of these items, and it will make you life easier.

Specifically, t.test()

Here's a brief overview of the method in R:


`
t.test(x, y = NULL,
              alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
              mu = 0, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,
              conf.level = 0.95, ...)
`

As you can see, it's stunningly simple, and concise. 

So, writing code to perform this test is easy.

Understanding when it's appropriate to implement the test is where you'll spend your time. 

A basic model of situations follows, 

|T-Test|
|------|
|**Conditions and Assumptions**:|
|N = Small, N < 30|
|Data is continuous or ordinal|
|Randomly, representatively sampled|
|Normally distributed|
|Equal variance -- Otherwise consider Welch's|
|**Common Uses:**|
|Hypothesis testing of equality means between two populations|
|Paired T-Test| 
|One sample location test|
