You'll need the shell. Here's enough to make you useful.

# FUNDAMENTAL COMMANDS

I've compiled a collection of relevant concepts, commands, flags, and approaches for common data-centric uses
of the shell, as well as fundamentals you should know. 

# Directories

## Present Working Directory

`pwd`: Reveals which directory you are currently working in, pwd = present working directory, easy right?

## Viewing Directory Contents

`ls`: Reveals the contents of your pwd

## Changing Directories

`cd`: 'change directory', use this to change your pwd

`cd ..` : Moves you up one level in your folder hierarchy 

Example:

`home/users/me ` cd.. --> pwd --> home/users

## Copying Files

`cp`: Copy files, use in the form of `cp filename.txt newfilename.txt` 

You can specify a new directory by specifying in the form of `cp filename.txtnewfilename.txt newdirectory`

## Moving Files

`mv`: Move file, use in the form of `mv filename.txt newdirectory` 

You can also use this to rename a file, but, this is dangerous because you run the risk of 
writing over a file with the same name if it already exists.

## Deleting Files

`rm`: remove, use this to delete files. 

Run the command in the form of `rm filename.txt`  

You can string multiple `rm` commands by simply adding filenames and folder hierarchies, Example: 

`rm filename1.txt filename2.txt /home/users/me/filename3.txt`

## Deleting Folders

`rmdir`: removes entire directory, but you have to remove individual files first as 
a safety feature to prevent a massive loss of data unintentionally

## Creating Directories 

`mkdir`: creates a new directory, Example:

`mkdir /home/users/me/newdirectory`

# Viewing and Manipulating Data

## Viewing File Contents 

`cat`: displays the contents of a file you specify. 

Cat is short for 'concatenate' Example: 

`cat hello.txt` ---> Hello World!

`less`: Returns a page worth of information from a file. Use `spacebar` to view the next page, `:n` to see a second 
file if it was specifed, or `q` to end viewing

`head`: Returns a small sample of the start of your text file, or if the contents are sufficiently small, it just 
displays them all

`tail`: same function as head, but returns ending entries in a file

## Shortcuts

Tab auto-completion:  Shell has the ability toautocomplete your request, you can simply 
enter enough of a title to locate it,assuming no conflicting matching titles, and press tab to autocomplete.

This can be extended to include a shortened directory and a shortened filename within that directory. Example: 
`head h <tab>` should autocomplete to `home`

`-n`  will allow us to specify a number of lines to be returned from a file. Example: 
`head -n 15 filename.txt` would return the first 15 lines within filename.txt

`-R`: Yields a recursive list of all subdirectories

`-F`: places a '/' key following directories, and a '*' after executable programs 

## Help

`man`: Returns helpful information about commands, such as `man ls` would yield a brief synopsis/description

`history`: Returns a list of recently entered commands into the shell. You can utilize this to automate commands in the list by accessing them via `!12` where 12 would indicate the 12th line of the history.

## Selecting Columns

`cut`: Returns columns of a file, structured as follows:

`cut -f 1-3, 5-7 -d , filename.csv`

This would return columns 1,2,3,5,6,7 with `-d` signifying a delimiter, which we defined as a comma ','.

## Merging Columns
`paste`: Similar to cut, selects columns, but merges them into a new set of columns.

## Regular Expressions
`grep`: Allows us to search for, and return, lines in a specified document that contain a matching word/string/defined regex. Example:
`grep ProductA user/me/FinancialStatement.csv` would return all lines containing the keyworkd "ProductA". 

Useful flags for a `grep` call include:

`-i`: Ignores upper/lower case

`-n`: Returns the lines with matches

`-l`: Returns the file names with matches

`-c`: Returns the number of matches

`-v`: Returns the number of non-matches

## Pipe

`|`: Allows us to extract data, and process it with another command. 

Example:
`tail -10 /user/me/20favoritebooks.txt | head -5` is a convuluted way to first get the bottom 10 entries of my list of 20 favorite books, and then return the upper 5 of that bottom 10.

With piping, you'll be able to use an output as an input for another command. It's important to note you're not only limited to a single input/output relationship, you can string together many input-output-input-output commands in a single call by simply extending with a `|` pipe
