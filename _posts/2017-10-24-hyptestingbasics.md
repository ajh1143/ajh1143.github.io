title: Hypothesis Testing - A Primer
---

Hypothesis testing is a powerful methodology for scientists and analysts alike. 

Thankfully, it is a fairly straightforward endeavor, which I've outlined below. 


|          Hypothesis Testing - Main Steps              |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
|(A)Declare your null hypothesis (Ho)                   |
|(B)Declare your alternative hypothesis (Ha)            |
|(C)Set your significance level(alpha α) for your assay |
|(D)Conduct your experiment                             |
|(E)Record observations/results                         |
|(F)Compute probability of your results                 |
|(G)Make a decision based on your p-value               |


In college, I read a lot of white papers, A LOT OF THEM. Thankfully, there is a methodology to dissecting the often dense material
that goes hand-in-hand with the statistical analysis of hypothesis testing.
